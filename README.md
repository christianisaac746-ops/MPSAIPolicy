# MPSAIPolicy
AI Policy I created, and presented to the Mcloud Public School System School Board.
Mcloud Public Schools AI Governance and Policy Project
🛡️ Project Overview: AI Policy Development and Governance
This repository documents the comprehensive process used to develop and implement a responsible Artificial Intelligence (AI) Policy for the Mcloud Public School District. This project demonstrates robust skills in policy creation, risk analysis, compliance (FERPA), stakeholder management, and integrating emerging technology securely within an educational environment.

The core deliverable is the final AI policy, which governs the ethical, pedagogical, and secure use of generative AI tools (like ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.) by students, staff, and administrators across the district.

🚀 Key Achievements
Policy Creation: Developed a comprehensive, district-wide AI policy focusing on academic integrity, equity, and data privacy.

Stakeholder Consensus: Managed a multi-school task force to gather diverse requirements and build consensus across the K-12 spectrum.

Security & Compliance Focus: Integrated key cybersecurity and data governance principles (FERPA, data minimization, privacy controls) into the final policy structure.

Agile Iteration: Successfully incorporated high-level governance and implementation suggestions from the Superintendent, resulting in a robust, future-proof policy.

🧠 Thought Process and Planning (Phase I: Task Force & Draft)
The project began by recognizing the immediate need for a unified policy to manage the security, integrity, and ethical challenges posed by readily available generative AI. The goal was to create a policy that augments human creativity rather than replaces it.

1. AI Task Force Formation (Decentralized Input)
To ensure the policy was practical and reflected the needs of all educational levels (Elementary, Middle, and High School), a district-wide AI Task Force was formed.

Composition: Each school nominated representatives (e.g., teachers, principals, instructional leaders).

Meetings: The Task Force met every Monday for several months.

Objective: To define what responsible AI utilization looked like for their specific student population, covering topics like appropriate assignment design, age-appropriate tool usage, and potential security risks.

2. Initial Policy Draft Creation (Consolidating Requirements)
Based on the Task Force feedback, the initial policy draft was structured around three pillars:

Academic Integrity: Defining proper citation and acceptable use to prevent plagiarism.

Pedagogical Guidance: Providing teachers with instructions on designing AI-resistant assignments.

Basic Ethics/Security: Establishing foundational rules for data privacy and avoiding sensitive data input.

The result of this intensive, collaborative process was the first draft of the "Mcloud Public Schools AI Policy.docx."

📊 Policy Revision and Governance Integration (Phase II: Superintendent Review)
The initial draft was presented to the Superintendent for final approval. The Superintendent provided essential high-level feedback, which shifted the policy's focus from mere control to robust Governance and Continuous Assessment.

Area	Superintendent's Key Addition	Cybersecurity/Governance Impact
Data & Privacy	Mandating compliance with FERPA and requiring strong security measures for any AI tool used.	Direct requirement for data protection, risk assessment of third-party tools, and legal compliance.
Equity	Ensuring equitable access and addressing algorithmic bias in AI tools.	Focus on fairness in system design and continuous monitoring of outcomes to prevent discrimination.
Governance	Establishing an AI Advisory Board of diverse stakeholders.	Creation of a formal Risk Management and Compliance body for AI, ensuring human oversight and accountability.
Accountability	Implementing a plan for continuous evaluation and feedback to measure AI's impact.	Mandating a Security and Efficacy Auditing cycle for all AI deployments.

📁 Repository Contents (Final Policy Structure)
The final, integrated policy document contains several key sections that are particularly relevant to a cybersecurity and governance portfolio:

Rationale and Purpose: Outlines the legal and ethical necessity for the policy.

Classroom Considerations: Details rules for Transparency and Accountability (e.g., assignment-specific rules, modeling ethical use).

NEW: Data Privacy, Security, and Equity: (Crucial for compliance) Explicitly addresses FERPA, data minimization, and closing the digital divide.

NEW: AI Governance and Continuous Assessment: (Crucial for oversight) Establishes the AI Advisory Board, empowers educators, and outlines the annual review process.

💻 Tech Stack & Tools
Policy Management: Microsoft Word / Google Docs (for collaborative editing)

Policy Analysis/Integration: Generative AI (used as a tool to compare and seamlessly integrate document versions)

Compliance Framework: FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act)
